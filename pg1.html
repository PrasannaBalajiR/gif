            <p>The emoji was predated by the emoticon,[12] a concept first put into practice in 1982 by computer scientist Scott Fahlman when he suggested text-based symbols such as :-) and :-( could be used to replace language.[13] Theories about language replacement can be traced back to the 1960s, when Russian novelist and professor Vladimir Nabokov stated in an interview with The New York Times "I often think there should exist a special typographical sign for a smile â€” some sort of concave mark, a supine round bracket."[14] It didn't become a mainstream concept until the 1990s when Japanese, American and European companies started experimenting with modified versions of Fahlman's idea.</p>
